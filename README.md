# Preamble

**WE THE MEMBERS OF THE SLEEPY BOIS CLUB**

**ACKNOWLEDGE**&#x20;

the _seemingly_ evident absurdity and meaninglessness in the world

the pervasive pains of loneliness, hopelessness, and emptiness

and the failures of prominent modern ideologies–tainted by the interests of entities which benefit from its perpetuation–in resolving the discontentment caused by the illusion of sense and nonsense alike

**ASSERT**

that we are not above the illusion but are inextricably part of it

that being well (in any of its forms) is the preferable illusion

and that magnanimous and impartial kindness is essential to but presently absent from this necessary ongoing discourse&#x20;

**FORGE A PATH FORWARD IN THE PURSUIT OF MEANING**&#x20;

through the establishment of this community where, _with a spirit of defiance against and a knowing smile for the adversities of the human experience_, individuals may safely seek meaning, purpose, and fulfillment by facilitating connection to the Self and the Other and bringing sincerity to third places in the optimistic exploration and practice of philosophy and kindness.
