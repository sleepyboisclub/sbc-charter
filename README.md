# Preamble

**WE THE MEMBERS OF THE SLEEPY BOIS CLUB**

**ACKNOWLEDGE**&#x20;

the _seemingly_ evident absurdity and meaninglessness in the world

the ubiquitous vicissitudes of loneliness, hopelessness, and emptiness

and the inefficacy of prominent modern ideologies–which are tainted by the interests of entities which benefit from their perpetuation–as solutions to these troubles

**ASSERT**

that we are not above the illusion but are inextricably part of it

that being well (in any of its forms) is the preferable illusion

and that indiscriminate kindness is essential and absent in this necessary discourse

**FORGE A PATH FORWARD IN THE PURSUIT OF MEANING**&#x20;

through the establishment of this community where individuals may safely seek meaning, purpose, and fulfillment by facilitating connection to self and other and bringing sincerity to third places in the optimistic exploration and practice of philosophy and kindness.
