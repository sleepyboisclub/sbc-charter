# Decision-Making Process

All club decisions are made by Unanimous Croak.

## Unanimous Croak

All decisions shall be made by Membership consensus, the voice of each member being essential to Unanimous Croak.

### Guidelines for Unanimous Croak

The scope and success requirements of Unanimous Croak.

#### Scope

All decisions regarding Club Administration require the Unanimous Croak of all Membership. Club Administration includes (but are not limited to):

1. Members and Membership
2. Club Officers
3. Amendments to the Charter
4. The public image of the Club

**Subaltern Unanimous Croak**

A lesser form of Unanimous Croak for minor decisions.

Where the repercussions of decision are within the scope of a single activity or date without affecting members who are not present, a Subaltern Unanimous Croak may comprise the voices of the members present without a [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XernRVKe4QxJDk0ka3EtGjtw3ZFzgvzVMG3F9Dj3Wpg/edit#heading=h.gyq3u3fysd32), [deliberation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XernRVKe4QxJDk0ka3EtGjtw3ZFzgvzVMG3F9Dj3Wpg/edit#heading=h.p206niu33zr0), or recording of dissent. Members are encouraged to consider the preferences of guests in Subaltern Unanimous Croak (as guests are not permitted to participate in any Unanimous Croak).

#### Requirements for Successful Unanimous Croak

The requirements for reaching Unanimous Croak align with the general principles of consensus:

1. All members must have communicated express agreement or intent to stand aside regarding the proposal.
2. All dissent, reservations, and reasons for standing aside must have been recorded.
3. No member must have acted to block the proposal.

### Process of Unanimous Croak

The procedure \[ðŸ’€ (and lack thereof)] of Unanimous Croak.

#### Proposals

Any member may present a proposal at any meetup croak for the purpose of reaching Unanimous Croak.

Proposals must include information about:

1. The problem the proposal addresses
2. How the proposal aligns with the [SBC Mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYzyi2lL5mu1zZwvimI\_48eSwcOZSUxjt-ZNeum5QcY/edit#heading=h.qa5ndbktrlt4)
3. The impact to stakeholders, which may include the club, members, and the broader community

All proposals must be announced on the appropriate communication channels for deliberation before reaching Unanimous Croak.

#### Deliberation and Timeline

There is no restriction regarding the format of deliberation \[ðŸ’€; anarchy may ensue]. Deliberation is carried out with the goal of drafting a proposal that best meets the needs of the club and its members. Proposals should be edited and revised according to the reservations of dissenting members and may be presented for Unanimous Croak multiple times throughout the duration of deliberation.

Initial proposals must be announced at any meetup croak. The final decision is made by and announced at the next possible meetup croak.

Proposals may be presented multiple times, but may not be presented at the same meetup croak where Unanimous Croak failed to succeed regarding the same proposal, including proposals with revisions.

#### Duty of Dissent

Dissent is encouraged when members do not agree with a proposal. Dissenting voices are not just equal but essential to the [SBC Mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYzyi2lL5mu1zZwvimI\_48eSwcOZSUxjt-ZNeum5QcY/edit#heading=h.qa5ndbktrlt4).

When dissent occurs, at least one dissenting member must articulate the reasons for their dissent. All dissenting members are encouraged to consider and communicate conditions that would resolve their reservations for the sake of other members and the Club Mission.

When participating in a Unanimous Croak, an accommodating, respectful, and humble disposition is expected of members who hold majority and minority opinions alike. \[ðŸ’€ Remember that SBC decisions are of little significance in the grand scheme of things.]

#### Absence&#x20;

In the case that a club member is unable to participate in a Unanimous Croak due to absence at meetup croaks and in regular SBC communication channels, a Unanimous Croak may succeed without the voice of the absent member after at least 28 days must have passed from the initial proposal and reasonable attempts must have been made to contact the absent member.
