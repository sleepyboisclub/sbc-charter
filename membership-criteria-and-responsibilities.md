# Membership

Those who align with the core values of the [Club Mission](mission-statement.md) (i.e. connection, sincerity, and kindness) may seek to become members; participation in the SBC is entirely voluntary and does not require membership.

Membership in the SBC means being a stakeholder in the Club Mission by both deriving its benefit and driving it forward to the benefit of others. Current and future members demonstrate their desire for membership through the investment of active participation.

## Requirements for Membership

1. Observe the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
2. Connect with the SBC community
3. Be voted in by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak)

The only barrier to entry in the SBC is a vested interest in the [Club Mission](mission-statement.md). An individual may be considered for membership after connecting to the SBC community through participation at in-person activities or in online forums for a period comprising six of the last 12 months and demonstrating a willingness to observe the Code of Conduct. \[ðŸ’€ _Put simply, you must pass the vibe check._]

## Responsibilities of Membership

1. Observe the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
2. [Croak](meetings-and-communication.md) in the SBC community
3. Participate in [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak)
4. Contribute to the [Annual Community Service Project](meetings-and-communication.md#annual-community-service-project)
5. Pay membership dues

The SBC should not become a burden in a personâ€™s life nor their top priority. Members are not required to participate in all [Croaks](meetings-and-communication.md#croaks-meetups), but must demonstrate vested interest through participation at in-person activities, discussion on any forum, or contributing to [SBC derivative media](meetings-and-communication.md#derivative-media) _as their time permits_. If a lack of participation becomes a hindrance to the [Club Mission](mission-statement.md), membership may be terminated for the sake of the club. However, membership is not required for continued participation in the club. Membership may be reinstated immediately, according to the [Requirements for Membership](membership-criteria-and-responsibilities.md#requirements-for-membership).

## Rights of Membership

1. Attend all [Croaks](meetings-and-communication.md#croaks-meetups)
2. Participate in all SBC discussions on all platforms
3. Directly influence the club through [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak)

The rights of SBC membership are the same as its requirements and responsibilities: the vested interest of participation in a philosophy and being kind club.

## Term of Membership

SBC Membership extends for a maximum period of one year, automatically and invariably terminating at the onset of the [Annual Croak of Election](meetings-and-communication.md#annual-croak-of-election).

## Termination of Membership

A member may terminate their membership at any time by request to the Executive Committee.

When failure to comply with the [Responsibilities of Membership](membership-criteria-and-responsibilities.md#responsibilities-of-membership) becomes a hindrance to the [Club mission](mission-statement.md), a [proposal](decision-making-process.md#proposals) for membership termination may be made at any time by any club member and must be passed by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak).
