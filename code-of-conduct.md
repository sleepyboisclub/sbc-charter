# Code of Conduct

The SBC Code of Conduct is governed by the [Club Mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYzyi2lL5mu1zZwvimI\_48eSwcOZSUxjt-ZNeum5QcY/edit#heading=h.qa5ndbktrlt4), at its core, facilitating connection to self and other, sincerity, and kindness. Let these be the guiding principles for the conduct of all Sleepy Bois.

When engaging on digital platforms, attending a community event or gathering in a public space or a private venue, SBC Members and Guests are to always be respectful and adhere to the house rules of the host institution.&#x20;

## SBC House Rules

The SBC House Rules for discussions and activities:

1. \[💀 Don’t talk about Fight Club]
2. Share the floor, don’t dominate
3. Embrace discomfort, delay dismissiveness
4. Bring your expertise and a disposition for learning
5. Seek to understand before being understood&#x20;
6. Explain your view without contempt
7. Acknowledge facts, validate experiences
8. Disagree without being disagreeable
9. If you bring it up, back it up \[💀 or politely shut the fuck up]
10. You are not your ideals, you are not your mistakes&#x20;
11. Be soft, vulnerability is hard
12. K.I.S.S. and make up
13. Come prepared or be self-aware

## Discussion Tools

1. Expectation to Privacy

&#x20;\[💀What happens at the SBC Croak doesn’t necessarily stay at the SBC Croak.]&#x20;

Generally, participants may discuss what happens at the SBC but must not attribute it to a specific individual. However, when requested by a participant, the Vegas Rule may apply to any discussion item. When the Vegas Rule is used in a meeting, it means that everything that will be said in the meeting stays in the meeting, just as “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.”

2. Parking Lot

The Parking Lot is a place where participants can park off-topic or tangential topics, questions or comments for a later time.&#x20;

Any participant can suggest a thread of thought be parked, but all participants should agree before parking a thought. Parking Lot items must be noted by the secretary or designated member and posted to an appropriate forum for post-croak discussion.

3. Timeout

In the case that a participant does not comply with the Code of Conduct, any participant may call a timeout.&#x20;

Timeouts are not punishments, but a break in the action for teammates to check in with each other.&#x20;

Participants who call timeout must do so with an attitude of patience and care. Participants are encouraged to exercise humility when timed out, seeking to understand why the timeout was called and how they can contribute to reaching a resolution.&#x20;

In all activities, discussions, and conflicts, SBC participants are encouraged to resolve issues quickly and modestly. Whatever issue may arise within the scope of the SBC matters very little in the grand scheme of things. \[💀This is just a silly little club: act accordingly.]
