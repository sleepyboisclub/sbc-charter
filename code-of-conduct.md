# Code of Conduct

The SBC Code of Conduct is governed by the [Club Mission](mission-statement.md), at its core, facilitating _connection_, _sincerity_, and _kindness_. Let these be the guiding principles for the conduct of all Sleepy Bois.

## Intentions of Conduct

A comprehensive list of behavioral rules is incongruent with the subjective nature of the [Club Mission](mission-statement.md) and the optimism upon which the club is founded. Instead of creating stipulations for worst-case scenarios, this section outlines the intentions for SBC conduct. \[ðŸ’€ _Call it wishful thinking because it is._]

SBC participants should conduct themselves with the following intentions:

1. Create a safe environment for other participants by treating them with respect and kindness
2. Share sincere vulnerability when appropriate and treat vulnerability softly
3. Get out of your comfort zone
4. Recognize the complexity of truth (that more than one thing can be true at the same time)
5. Take accountability for and be willing to forgive mistakes

In addition to these intentions, SBC members and guests should adhere to the rules of the host institution when engaging on digital platforms, attending a community event or gathering in a public space or a private venue. \[ðŸ’€ _Sleepy bois donâ€™t talk about Flight Club._]

## Tools for Facilitating Activities

In all activities, discussions, and conflicts, participants are encouraged to resolve issues quickly and modestly. Whatever issue may arise within the scope of the SBC matters very little in the grand scheme of things. \[ðŸ’€ _This is just a silly little club: act accordingly._]

### Expectation to Privacy

\[ðŸ’€ _What happens at the SBC doesnâ€™t necessarily stay at the SBC._]

Generally, participants may discuss what happens at the SBC but must not attribute it to a specific individual without their express consent. However, when requested by a participant in any form, items shared at an SBC discussion or activity must not leave that discussion or activity.

### Parking Lot

Any participant can suggest an off-topic or tangential item, question or comment be parked for discussion at a later time. All participants should agree to using the Parking Lot before moving forward. Because the interests and thoughts of all are worthy of consideration, Parking Lot items must be noted by the secretary or designated member and posted to an appropriate forum for ongoing post-croak discussion.

### Timeout

A Timeout is not a punishment, but a break in the action for teammates to check in with each other and ensure mutual success.

Any participant may call a timeout with an attitude of patience and care to the end of meeting the Intentions of Conduct. Participants are encouraged to exercise humility when timed out, seeking to understand why the timeout was called and how they can contribute to reaching a resolution.
