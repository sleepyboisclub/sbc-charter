# Meetings and Communication

Basic guidelines for regular SBC activities, communications, and events, all of which are referred to as ‚ÄúCroaks.‚Äù

üíÄ The SBC is cognizant of the confounding nature of homonominalizing terms that are critical to the nature and administrative functions of the SBC. We find this obfuscation delightfully absurd and hope this flummoxing circular word labyrinth brings you the same amusement it does us.

## Croaks (Meetups)

The SBC meets (croaks) officially once monthly. An official SBC meetup (croak) must meet the following requirements:

1. ### Quorum (Croak)

For an official meetup croak to occur, two or more Sleepy Bois must gather (croak).

2. ### Regular Monthly Schedule

Meetup Croaks occur on the first Monday of the month with exception. The permitting of exceptions to the regular schedule of Meetup Croaks is the purview of the Program Chair. Exceptions must be properly announced (croaked) to all SBC Members.

3. ### Announcement (Croak) to all Members

Meetup Croaks are to be announced to all SBC Members via the proper communication channels at the beginning of the preceding month, including a description of the activity, date, time, and location.

4. ### Rules of Disorder

The SBC Rules of Order for a Meetup Croak are as follows:

1. Call to Disorder
2. Welcome to Members and Guests
3. Election (Croak) of the Sleepy Boi King
4. Announcements
   1. Club Announcements

5. Group Photo
6. Introduction of Activity/Guest Expert

8. Call to Disorder



5. ### &#x20;Post-Croak Post Croak

A blog post (Croak) about the Meetup (Croak) must be published in a timely manner following its completion (post-Croak).&#x20;

If only one Sleepy Boi attends an activity that meets all other SBC requirements, that Sleepy Boi may (should) publish their experience as a Post-Croak Post Croak.

### Guests

Guests are allowed to attend Meetup Croaks by way of invitation from an SBC Member. Guests must agree to adhere to the SBC [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EMO1nDaEUJ9u\_9oyXEEYFE0vLhF8S2gkg4aAlnLqfoQ/edit#heading=h.446mjsktjjlw).

### Format

When possible, meetup croaks are streamed on the SBC Discord server. Members and guests are welcome to attend all croaks in-person or remotely. All are invited to participate in post-croak discussion (croaking), which occurs in the Discord server or via other mediums.

### Annual Community Service Project

At least one Meetup Croak must be a community service or charity project annually. This Croak is to be planned under the guidance of the [Executive Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vlKNBZYVYcb4ID00THvMkpGeKkYn-y616M0sGDI-R4/edit#heading=h.jglvb0lxgvho), according to the input of club membership.

## Croaking (Communication)

The SBC maintains reliable and transparent communication (croaking) with its membership via official membership communication channels and hosts public digital third places in the form of discussion platforms, publications, and social media accounts.

Pre-Croak Study Guides and Post-Croak Post Croaks are published monthly and shared on the SBC Discord server in the appropriate channels as a source of information and a catalyst for topical discussion (croaking) outside of Meetup Croaks.

The [Executive Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vlKNBZYVYcb4ID00THvMkpGeKkYn-y616M0sGDI-R4/edit#heading=h.jglvb0lxgvho) can be contacted directly in the Discord server or at the SBC email.

### Derivative Works

The SBC publishes derivative content to a number of public social media platforms. Members and Guests are encouraged to create content and derivative media that is consistent with the [SBC Mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYzyi2lL5mu1zZwvimI\_48eSwcOZSUxjt-ZNeum5QcY/edit#heading=h.qa5ndbktrlt4) for publication on official SBC platforms and accounts. All content published to official SBC social media accounts is the purview of the Communications Chair with guidance from the [Executive Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vlKNBZYVYcb4ID00THvMkpGeKkYn-y616M0sGDI-R4/edit#heading=h.jglvb0lxgvho).

## Croaks (Events)

When appropriate, the SBC participates in and may host public events (Croaks). Official SBC events and participation in community events is the purview of the [Executive Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vlKNBZYVYcb4ID00THvMkpGeKkYn-y616M0sGDI-R4/edit#heading=h.jglvb0lxgvho). Members, Guests, and community members are encouraged to discuss community opportunities with the Public Relations Representative.

## Annual Croak of Election

The Annual Croak of Election is a meetup croak activity wherein members and officers are voted into the club for the year.

The [Deliberation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XernRVKe4QxJDk0ka3EtGjtw3ZFzgvzVMG3F9Dj3Wpg/edit#heading=h.p206niu33zr0) of all Annual Croak of Election decisions occurs in the course of the meetup croak, rather than spanning the time between two croaks according to the [Process of Unanimous Croak](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XernRVKe4QxJDk0ka3EtGjtw3ZFzgvzVMG3F9Dj3Wpg/edit#heading=h.gw4yigpflsid).
