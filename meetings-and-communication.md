# Meetings and Communication

Meetings and communication are facilitated with the goal of reviving sincerity in third places, according to the [Club Mission](mission-statement.md). This section outlines the basic guidelines for regular SBC activities, communications, and events, all of which are referred to as ‚ÄúCroaks.‚Äù

\[üíÄ _The SBC is cognizant of the confounding nature of homonominalizing terms that are critical to the nature and administrative functions of the SBC. We find this obfuscation delightfully absurd and hope this confounding word puzzle brings you the same amusement it does us._]

## Croaks (Meetups)

The SBC meets \[croaks] officially on a monthly basis. An official SBC meetup \[croak] must meet the following requirements:

1. Quorum \[croak] (two or more Sleepy Bois)
2. Regular schedule
3. Announcement \[croak]
4. [Rules of Disorder](meetings-and-communication.md#rules-of-disorder)
5. Post-Croak Post Croak

To make attendance easier for members, monthly Croaks should follow a regular schedule that best meets the needs of club members. Regularly-scheduled Croaks as well as exceptions to the regular schedule must be announced to all SBC members via official communication channels at the beginning of the preceding month, including a description of the activity, date, time, and location.

To the end of impartially and sincerely sharing the value of the SBC with the broader community, a blog post \[croak] about the meetup \[Croak] must be published in a timely manner following its completion \[post-Croak]. If only one sleepy boi attends an activity that meets all other SBC requirements, that sleepy boi may (should) publish their experience as a Post-Croak Post Croak.

When possible, Croaks are made available to remote members and guests. All are invited to participate in post-croak discussion \[croaking], which may occur on any SBC platform or digital third place.

Guests may attend Croaks in-person by way of invitation from an SBC member. Guests must agree to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Annual Community Service Project

One meetup \[Croak] must be a community service or charity project annually. This Croak is to be planned under the guidance of the Executive Committee, according to the input of club membership.

In the case that a member is unable to attend the Annual Community Service Project, an alternative project may be approved by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak) to meet the [Responsibilities of Membership](membership-criteria-and-responsibilities.md#responsibilities-of-membership).

## Annual Croak of Election

The Annual Croak of Election is a meetup \[Croak] activity wherein members and officers are voted into the club for the year.

The [deliberation](decision-making-process.md#deliberation-and-timeline) of all Annual Croak of Election decisions occurs in the course of the meetup croak, rather than spanning the time between two croaks according to the process of [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak).

#### Election Process

1. Call to disorder by the incumbent President
2. Unanimous Croak of Membership for each interested individual
3. Creation of an Executive Committee Proposal
4. Executive Committee Proposal must be passed by Unanimous Croak
5. Call to disorder by the incumbent President

## Croaking (Communication)

The SBC hosts public digital third places in the form of discussion platforms, publications, and social media accounts.

Pre-Croak Study Guides and Post-Croak Post Croaks are published monthly and shared on appropriate communication channels as a catalyst for topical discussion \[croaking] outside of meetups \[Croaks].

### Derivative Media

The SBC publishes topical and thoughtful derivative content to public platforms. Members and Guests are encouraged to create content and derivative media that is consistent with the [SBC Mission](mission-statement.md) for publication on official SBC platforms and accounts. All content published to official SBC social media accounts is the purview of the Communications Chair with guidance from the Executive Committee.

## Croaks (Public Events)

When appropriate, the SBC participates in and may host public events \[Croaks]. Official SBC events and participation in community events is the purview of the Public Relations Representative and Executive Committee.
