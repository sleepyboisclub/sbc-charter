# Leadership Structure

The SBC operates under and by direction of its Executive Committee, comprising all elected club officers, which bears the responsibility of fulfilling the [SBC Mission](mission-statement.md) according to the desires of club membership.

### Officers and Committees

Given that the SBC operates on volunteer efforts and limited resources, the structure of club leadership is mostly undefined to avoid an excessive number of vacant offices.

Members are encouraged to volunteer as club officers, taking responsibility for any combination of club operations and creating a title of office fitting to the responsibilities undertaken. The club President–the only necessary SBC office–takes accountability for the success of all officers and officer duties.

Individuals who do not wish to form part of the Executive Committee but would like to contribute to achieving the [Club Mission](mission-statement.md) may participate in an ad hoc committee. A committee may include non-member individuals but a committee head must be a member and elected by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak).

### Officer Election

All SBC participation is voluntary. As such, SBC offices are appointed by way of volition and not by way of delegation or nomination. All members are encouraged to volunteer as club officers.

Officers are croaked in at the [Annual Croak of Election](meetings-and-communication.md#annual-croak-of-election), or as necessary by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak) in the case of vacancy.

In order to be eligible to hold office, candidates must:

1. Be an active club member
2. Have been a club member for at least seven months

### Term of Office

Officers hold their title for a period of one year, which begins immediately after the [Annual Croak of Election.](meetings-and-communication.md#annual-croak-of-election)

Officers who are croaked in at any time outside of the Annual Croak of Election hold their office until the next Annual Croak of Election.

### Removal from Office

Any member may present a [proposal](decision-making-process.md#proposals) for impeachment croak at any time, whereby an officer may be removed by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak). In the case of an impeachment croak, only non-leader members may participate in the croak.
