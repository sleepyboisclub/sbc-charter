### Officer Election

All SBC participation is voluntary. As such, SBC offices are appointed by way of volition and not by way of delegation or nomination. All members are encouraged to volunteer as club officers.

Officers are croaked in at the [Annual Croak of Election](meetings-and-communication.md#annual-croak-of-election), or as necessary by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak) in the case of vacancy.

In order to be eligible to hold office, candidates must:

1. Be an active club member
2. Have been a club member for at least seven months
3. Hold only one club office at any given time

### Term of Office

Officers hold their title for a period of one year, which begins immediately after the [Annual Croak of Election](meetings-and-communication.md#annual-croak-of-election).

Officers who are croaked in at any time outside of the Annual Croak of Election hold their office until the next Annual Croak of Election.

### Removal from Office

Any member may present a [proposal](decision-making-process.md#proposals) for impeachment croak at any time, whereby an officer may be removed by [Unanimous Croak](decision-making-process.md#unanimous-croak). In the case of an impeachment croak, only non-leader members may participate in the croak.
