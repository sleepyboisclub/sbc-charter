In order for an office to be occupied, the office from which its duties percolate must not be vacant.

In the case of a complete vacancy of office, the club may operate without officers for a temporary period of time, but must croak in an Executive Committee as soon as possible.

### Officer Election

All SBC participation is voluntary. As such, SBC offices are appointed by way of volition and not by way of delegation. All members are encouraged to volunteer as club officers.

Officers are croaked in at the [Annual Croak of Election](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19cXujNa3A67xv-A6GMpLCIp\_eGhsStdJFnyF0PZvOP0/edit#heading=h.ngbu1s3ee4g), or as necessary by [Unanimous Croak](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XernRVKe4QxJDk0ka3EtGjtw3ZFzgvzVMG3F9Dj3Wpg/edit#heading=h.6h2hiean8lgl) in the case of vacancy.

### Removal from Office

Officers may be removed from office at any point by [Unanimous Croak](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XernRVKe4QxJDk0ka3EtGjtw3ZFzgvzVMG3F9Dj3Wpg/edit#heading=h.6h2hiean8lgl). In the case of an impeachment croak, only non-leader members may participate in the croak.

Any member may motion for an impeachment croak at any time.
